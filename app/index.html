                    These days, it seems like every inch of the web is covered with advertisements.
                    Online ads are both a nuisance and a security risk.  So block them.

                    <p>Advertising companies want to track everything you do on the Internet.  If you block
                    their ads, it's much harder for them to.  This helps preserve your online privacy.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes, ads are used by criminals to distribute malicious software, including
                    viruses and worms.  It has even happened on mainstream websites, like Forbes,

                    <p>Scammers can use online ads to fool people into buying fake products and spending

                    </h3>
                    <p>Every ad that appears on your screen got there through your internet or mobile data
                    connection, and is powered by your phone or laptop battery.  Those things cost you money.
                    If you use an adblocker, you aren't wasting your resources on loading advertisements.</p>

                    <p>The advertising industry is massive, and it distributes ads all around the world on a
                    colossal scale.  That's a lot of energy wasted on transmitting junk data that most people
                    ignore anyway.  You can reduce this waste by blocking ads.</p>

                    <p>When you browse the web, you aren't there to see ads.  You're there to read news, do
                    your shopping, and connect with friends.  Ads ruin this experience by slowing your
                    connection down, getting in the way, and distracting your attention.  Adblockers make
                    your experience online much faster and smoother.</p>
