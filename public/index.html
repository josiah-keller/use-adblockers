                    These days, it seems like every inch of the web is covered with advertisements.
                    Online ads are both a nuisance and a security risk.  So block them.

            <p>An adblocker is a small piece of software that you install on your computer.  It is an
            <b>extension</b> for your web browser that changes the way it works.  Normally, websites that you
            visit can tell your computer to display whatever ads it wants.  The adblocker steps in and stops
            your computer from showing the ads &mdash; in other words, it blocks them.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>Advertising companies want to track everything you do on the Internet.  If you block
                    their ads, it's much harder for them to.  This helps preserve your online privacy.</p>

                    <p>Every ad that appears on your screen got there through your Internet or mobile data
                    connection, and is powered by your phone or laptop battery.  Advertisers are essentially

                    <p>Digital advertising is a massive, global industry that uses enormous amounts of energy

                    <p>When you browse the web, you aren't there to see ads.  You're there to read the news, do
                    your shopping, and connect with friends.  Ads ruin this experience by slowing your
                    connection down, getting in the way, and distracting your attention.  Adblockers make
                    your experience online much faster and smoother.</p>
